## 🔑 API Key Setup (YouTube Data API v3)

This app requires access to the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch video statistics and comments.

### ▶️ How to get your API key:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**
4. Go to **Credentials** → Create credentials → **API Key**
5. Copy the API key

### ▶️ How to add API Key in the Code

- 1.Open the app.py file in the project directory.
- Locate the line where the API key is set in the code:
```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
- Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key:
```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
```
- 💡 Pro Tip: Be cautious not to share your API key in public repositories to avoid unauthorized usage.

## ✅ Running the App

Once setup is complete, launch the app using:

```bash
python app.py
```

It opens a desktop window where you can paste any YouTube video URL or ID to start analyzing.

## 🧪 Testing Accuracy
- To check the accuracy of the analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis or content classification), follow these steps:
-  1. Ensure Setup is Complete:
      Make sure you’ve cloned the repository, set up the virtual environment, installed dependencies, and added your API key as described in the "Getting Started" section.
   2. Run the Test Script:
      Execute the test.py script to evaluate accuracy:
```bash
python test.py
```
- 3. Expected Output:
     The script will display the accuracy results, such as classification accuracy for detecting inappropriate content or sentiment analysis precision. Check the terminal for detailed results.
  Notes:
i.Ensure you have the necessary data files (e.g., youtube_video_classification.csv) in the correct directory before running the script.
ii.If you encounter errors, verify that all dependencies are installed and the data paths in test.py are correct.
